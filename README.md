# CodeCool-Bootcamp

In this repository you will find all the projects we coded through our journey in this bootcamp.
TW weeks means that we had a teamweek and coded together.
SI means self instructed which means that we had to learn at home on ou own and solve our problems by ourself and code on our own.

Hope you will find this usefull to assess what I learned and how I'm using it.
